# 8-Bit Computer Built on Breadboards

<img src="../images/bdck4/final-computer.webp">

I built an 8-bit computer from scratch on multiple breadboards and documented the entire process. The computer has 16 bytes of RAM, a custom instruction set, and an ALU that can perform addition and subtraction.

**I sectioned each article based on the kit**

**[Kit 1 - Clock Module](../blog/bdck1.html)**

**[Kit 2 - Registers and ALU](../blog/bdck2.html)**

**[Kit 3 - RAM and Program Counter](../blog/bdck3.html)**

**[Kit 4 - Output and Control Logic](../blog/bdck4.html)**

Here it is multiplying 13*12=156.
